        ### Project Creation:

        - It enables the establishment of projects within Jira, incorporating a structured hierarchy that spans accounts, projects, epics, tasks, and sub-tasks.
        - The app supports the delineation of issue dependencies, allowing for the specification of relationships such as "blocks" and "is blocked by".
        - It offers the capability to calculate the start and end dates of tasks, based on the specified duration for each issue type.

        ### Weekly/Monthly Report Generation:

        - The application can retrieve issues from Jira for a specified project, according to the user-defined criteria for inclusion in the report.
        - It facilitates the creation of PowerPoint slide decks, aggregating and presenting the relevant project data succinctly.
        - Users are provided with the option to download the generated slide deck, enabling easy access and distribution of the report.


        ### Upcoming features
                    
        - Sharepoint Connection in order to make downloading and uploading of slidedecks unnecessary
        - Update the projectplan in the app
        - Issue Updates: Updating existing Jira issues based on changes in an Excel file (including changes to summary, status, start date, due date, and description)
        - Transition Handling: Manages transitions between different statuses of Jira issues.
